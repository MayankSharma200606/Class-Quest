Styling and Font Size
This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, which applies spacing, layout, and font size utilities for responsiveness and consistency. Common font sizes and spacing used:

Base font size: text-base (~16px) for body text.

Headings: increasing font sizes like text-2xl, text-3xl for section titles.

Margins and paddings: spaced with utilities like my-4, py-2, px-6 to maintain clean layout.

Feel free to customize the tailwind.config.ts to adjust fonts, spacing scales, or add new utility classes as needed.
